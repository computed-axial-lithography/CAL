% General parameters

params.angles = 0:2:178;                % vector of real angles of projection; should be [0-180 deg]
params.parallel = 0;                    % 1 to activate parallel computing; 0 to deactivate; require Parallel Computing toolbox
params.create_proj_for_2DCAL = 1;       % 1 to activate gen of projections for 2D planar CAL; 0 to deactivate
%%% EXPERIMENTAL %%%
params.axisymmetric = 0;                % 1 for axisymmetric targets; 0 for non-axisymmetric targets


%%% EXPERIMENTAL %%%
% Physical setup parameters (NOTE: if resin_abs_coeff is set angles should
% go from [0-360 deg]
params.voxel_size = 0.0457;               % side length of cubic voxel in mm

% Optimization parameters

params.Theta = 0.1;                    % Hybrid input-output parameter; Theta = 0 corresponds to perfect constraint
params.Beta = 0.5;                     % Memory Effect - how much of the previous iteration error is used in computing the current iteration update; Beta = 0 corresponds no memory
params.sigmoid = 150;                    % Sharpness of target dose boundary; typical values range from [50-200]
params.max_iterations = 20;             % number of iterations in the optimization
% params.tol;                           % use this to set the error tolerance of optimization

%% Optimization procedure
[target,target_care_area,params.domain_size] = voxelize_target(params); % prepare target 

projections = initialize_projections(params,target); % create initial guess of projections

[optimized_projections,optimized_reconstruction,error,thresholds] = optimize_projections(params,projections,target,target_care_area); % optimize projections to minimize error between target and reconstruction
